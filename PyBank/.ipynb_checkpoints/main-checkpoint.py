"""Chris Groshong: PyBank.

Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. 
This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

This script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
> The total number of months included in the dataset.
> The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
> The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
> The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
> The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
