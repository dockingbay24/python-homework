"""Chris Groshong: PyRamen.

Python script for analyzing the analyze how well your business did on a per-product basis 
in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, 
and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.

Read the data in,performate data manipulations
01-count: the total quantity for each ramen type
02-revenue: the total revenue for each ramen type
03-cogs: the total cost of goods sold for each ramen type
04-profit: the total profit for each ramen type

loop through sales and perform analysis

Write out the contents of the report dictionary to a text file. 
The report should output each ramen type as the keys and
01-count, 02-revenue, 03-cogs, and 04-profit metrics as the values for every ramen.
