## PyBank
Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. 

### Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:<br>
<br>
Financial Analysis<br>
----------------------------<br>
Total Months: 86<br>
Total: $38382578<br>
Average  Change: $-2315.12<br>
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)<br>
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)<br>

> Your final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
